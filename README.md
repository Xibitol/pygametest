# Pygame test [![License: LGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-LGPL_v3-orange.svg)](COPYING.LESSER)
This project is my test of the [Pygame library](https://github.com/pygame/pygame). I mean you'll find a playable
game made from all my ideas that was passed trough my head. So, I'm the author of the used assets and the entire code.

Also, **I'm absolutely not a game maker** : This is my first time trying to make a game alone with my code standards and
with the following of Python and Pygame conventions. If you're more talented about this subject, I gonna be happy to get
some reviews on my code, on my project architecture and some tips to improve it. _Thanks in advance!_

## Screenshots
Maybe one day?

## Roadmap
_This is what I need to do, in my opinion._
- [ ] Create the game core (CLI Launch Script, Game and its Mode, )  
- [ ] ... _(Not fully completed)_

## Setup
### Installation
_I will tell that soon_
### Using
_I will explain that soon_

## License
_WARNING: This is just to not see my production under another author name! But, you can use it as a library._
